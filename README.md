# lets_cli

LANGUAGE EXECUTION TERMINAL SUPPORT (Lets)

## Description

`lets_cli` is a command-line tool that acts as an intelligent assistant for your CLI. It interprets natural language commands and translates them into executable shell commands, making it ideal for users who may not remember specific commands or want to streamline their workflow using plain English.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Processing:** Converts plain English commands into shell commands using a powerful NLP model.
- **Interactive Execution:** Displays the interpreted command to the user and waits for confirmation before execution.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies terminal interactions, making it accessible even to those with limited command-line knowledge.

## Recommended OpenAI Models

gpt-3.5-turbo offers a good balance of cost and reasoning. For heavier reasoning tasks you can switch to gpt-4-turbo.


## How It Works

1. The user types a natural language command using the lets command.
2. lets_cli sends this input to an NLP API for interpretation.
3. The interpreted shell command is displayed to the user.
   Upon user confirmation, the command is executed in the terminal.
